# spring-tiles-bs-jsp-47
This covers the Spring Tutorials 4-7 on YouTube by Jiri Pinkas

## Introduction
In these three videos, Jiri covers three topics:
1. Using Apache Tiles in Spring
2. Using Twitter Bootstrap in your app
3. The servlet/JSP API
4. Using Spring Context (Best Practice -- really a superstition?)

This builds on top of the springtut13 project. I basically started off by copying the [pom.xml of that project](https://github.com/kedarmhaswade/springtut13/blob/master/pom.xml) 
before making changes here.
